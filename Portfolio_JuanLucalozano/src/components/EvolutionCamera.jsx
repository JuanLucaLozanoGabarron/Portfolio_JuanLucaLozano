        <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always been impressed by technological developments and I wanted
          to put the cameras In the spotlight. With parallax effects you scroll
          from one year to the next.
          <br />
          Each period has its own explanation and photo.
          <br />
          Where we see the most evolution are the photos taken by these cameras.
          I wanted to show them in a fun and inspiring way to make them more
          inspiring than the others.
