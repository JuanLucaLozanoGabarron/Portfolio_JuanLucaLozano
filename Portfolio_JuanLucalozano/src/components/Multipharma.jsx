        <p>
          In collaboration with In The Pocket, we had to work as a group to come
          up with alternatives to improve MultiPharmaâ€™s mobile application. By
          improving the interface and adding more functionality requested by
          customers as well as pharmacists and doctors, we tried to make life
          easier for consumers.

          Smooth navigation and accurate information are the guidelines of this
          project.
