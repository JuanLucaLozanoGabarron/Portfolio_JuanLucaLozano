            With my colleague Quentin, we created a video using a drone. The aim
            of the video was to tell a story using a drone. The theme chosen was
            nature and the tranquillity it represents. We tried to show people
            in the city that nature is a place where we can reconnect with
            ourselves without anyoneâ€™s help.
